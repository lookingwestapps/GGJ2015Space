# Memories Of Earth
This game was created in 48 hours for the [2015 Global Gam Jam](http://globalgamejam.org/2015/games/memories-earth).

This year’s theme was a question: “What do we do now?”

##### Status
The game has been modified since the end of the game jam. You can checkout the commit from the end of the jam by cloning the repo and running:

### Description

A lone astronaut adrift in space after the total destruction of Earth. During your final moments you reflect on the memories that remain. Developed for the Oculus Rift DK2 (SDK v0.4.4) to provide total immersion.
